## How do I interact with my pet?

Once you have created a pet, you can interact with it by clicking the "Interact" button on the pet's page. You will be prompted to choose an action for your pet to perform. Once you have done so, click the "Interact" button. You will be prompted to confirm the transaction in your Ethereum wallet. Once you have done so, your pet will perform the action you chose.
